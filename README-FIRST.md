Qestion. Find the Element Which Present Maximun Number of Time's in Array.

Time Complexity : O(n^2) 
Space Complexity: O(1)

Here we use two for loops. 
We check each element in the array with all other elements and keep track of count and 
also we maintain the max counter which track the element repeats the maximum number of time.

I'm found this solution for that problem is much more simple.
